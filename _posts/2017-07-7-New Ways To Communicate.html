Lately I have been trying to think about new ways we can show you guys our progress on Noah's Oath via our blog.
 So every time a new patch in the game is released I have decided to make a video showing the highlights of each patch in game. The next patch will have a model for the lion a basic animation for running. You will see this in the first
video. You can find all of our videos <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5FKjF0LOACyU2Pk1A5u__w" target="_link">here</a>.
<br><br>
We also now have an email where you can give us feedback or just ask us a question. Also, if you spot a bug you can use this email to let us know but make sure to send a picture to help us identify the problem. You can now also follow us
on <a href="https://twitter.com/NoahsOath" target="_link">twitter</a> to get notified of new posts!
<br><br>
In patch 0.0.3-Alpha the lion model will be implemented into the game. This model is still in an early stage so over time you will notice it slightly change over time for improvement. (Model changes will be logged)
<br><br>
In the first video we will show you the mechanics we have and what we have planned to improve them. Note that right now we have shapes to represent various assets while they are in creation. The lion is our first member of this
world but not the last. Noah's Oath is built around the mechanic of changing into different animals. So, now that the morphing mechanic is functional you will see that new animals will be added to complete unique tasks.
<br><br>
And thats all I got for you guys today. I'll see you in the next post!
