Hello everyone! I have finally gotten around to make some Noah's Oath updates! It has been a
while since I really put some time into this game, but now that it is summer time, I will be
working on it a lot more. I am thinking about releasing our first beta soon, because I have
a plan on what we will add to the game. I wanted to add only 3 things.
<br><br>
The first thing I wanted to add is animal morphing. The entire reason that this game exsists
is because we had the idea of an animal that could morph into other animals. Basically, thoughout
this game's time, we will be adding new animals that you can unlock and change into them at will.
The bad news is that my first attempt at adding this feature is that there would be a lot of glitches,
such as the camera not following the right character, or the character not being able to look around,
or multiple animals in the scene at once. I have fixed all of those problems, thankfully. Now our game
has animal morphing. Hooray!
<br><br>
The second thing I wanted to add before the beta is a questing system. Noah's Oath is an RPG, and I dont know
any RPGs without quests. I will add this next, because it is very important to the game, and it will be fun
seeing it work.
<br><br>
The last thing that I wanted to add was an inventory, so that you could craft things and store them,
or so that you could get questing items and bring them to different places. I will be working on this last,
because in theory this would be the most complicated to pull off.
<br><br>
Our artist mastari is still working on models right now, so the game looks very ugly, because it is
made of cubes and planes with bright colors. We have 2 characters, a cube and a lion (which are both cubes)

As you can see, it's not very interesting yet. Once we add a few animals and maps, it will look awesome!
If you want to test our game, be sure to go to our github! We will not be compiling it until we release
the first beta, but if you want you can get unity, download noah's oath, and try it for yourself!
