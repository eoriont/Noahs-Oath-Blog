It's summer time! It's time to seize the day, enjoying the time to make new Noah's Oath updates!
We have been working more on the base mechanics of the game.
We have been creating the mechanic to morph from one animal to the next.
This is one of the most important aspects of the game so we will be touching up and refining this mechanic to the best of our ability.
As of now, we are minimizing the amount of vertices on the lion model to make sure that it won't lag out gameplay.
The problem with this is keeping the lion to look the same without making it low-poly.
In the next update we want to complete the animation cycles for the lion and complete the morphing mechanic. We will show images of our progress in the next post.
