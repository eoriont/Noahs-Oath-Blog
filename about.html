  Noah's Oath is an RPG where you play as animals.
   You must use your various abilities to do quests and other objectives.
   This game is still under development and we are working very hard trying to make it play and feel like a good game.
    We would love to hear what you think of the the new updates we make and you can follow along by going to <a href="../blogs.html">www.noahsoath.com/blogs</a>.
     If you leave a comment on a new blog post we always try our best to get back to everyone and take constructive criticism.
